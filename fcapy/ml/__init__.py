"""
This package provides classes to create ML models based on FCA ideas (concepts, lattices, generators, etc.)

Classes
-------
decision_lattice.DecisionLatticeRegressor:
    A class which combines DecisionTree ideas with Concept Lattice to solve Regression tasks
decision_lattice.DecisionLatticeClassifier:
    A class which combines DecisionTree ideas with Concept Lattice to solve Classification tasks

Modules
-------
decision_lattice:
    A module to store DecisionLatticeRegressor and DecisionLatticeClassifier classes
