# Changelog

## [0.1.4] - 2022-07-04

Pretty and easier-to-use visualizations via NetworkX.

### Added

Rewrite visualizer submodule to make visualizations more versatile and easy to use.
* Add LineVizNx: a class to visualize POSets and Concept Lattices via NetworkX  
* Add Mover: a class to simplify the positioning of nodes in a visualization
* Add many NetworkX-like parameters to AbstractLineViz to form an interface for future visualization extensions 

_Disclaimer_: The release was in production for too much time.
So something may not work properly (although it should).
I will try to publish the following releases more often.
